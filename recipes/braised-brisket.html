    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Braised brisket is cooked low and slow in wine for juicy, flavorful bites. This recipe
        is perfect for a weeknight meal or a holiday feast. Although many people prefer to smoke 
        or grill a brisket, this is one of my favorite ways to prepare this cut of meat. Once
        the brisket is seared it's laid on a bed of sauteed onions, carrots and celery. Garlic 
        and thyme are added to a reduction and everything is braised to tender perfection.
