This is a project that I am building as a part of The Odin Project. My hope is that it will help solidify the basics of HTML, Git, Github that I have learned so far. At the end of it I will write a brief summary of what I have learned.


Update:

I have completed this project although it is extremely basic. I am contemplating on coming back to it once I have better knowledge of CSS and fixing it up a little, but part of me wants to keep it as is so when I look back I can see the progression in my programming skills. This project helped me solidify my understanding of basic html concepts. I think the biggest learning lesson came from using git. I didnt really know when I should be making commits and what my messages should say. This project helped me realize I need to learn more about that process so that my actions are clear and concise. This will make it easier when going back through my code.
